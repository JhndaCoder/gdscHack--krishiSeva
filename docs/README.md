 ##  About

Our Team HTML5 created Krishi Seva as a prototype for Digital Village Hackathon - A 24 hour hackathon organsied by GDSC , Thapar University , Patiala where we were the winners of the best first year hack

The theme of the whole hackahton was Precision Agriculture and all the problem statements were based on devolping the persisting technology in P.A even more but their was no focus on its Implementation so we choose to work under Open-Innovation category to solve this challenge.

## Challenges in adopting Precision Agriculture in India

- The adoption of precision farming in India is yet in the nascent stage due to its unique pattern of land holdings, poor infrastructure, lack of farmers’ inclination to take the risk, social and economic conditions, and demographic conditions
- The small size of landholdings in most of the Indian agriculture limits economic gains from currently available precision farming technology.

## Miscellaneous

<!-- This section showcases some functionality of Docsify.

```bash
echo "Hello, World"
``` -->

- With the Indian agriculture sector growing at less than four percent per annum, it would take — at the current pace — 25 years for farmers’ income to double. But the Modi government’s aim to achieve it by 2022, in less than five years, certainly looks ambitious.
- Precision farming comes at a cost of ₹2 lakh per hectare. Also, adapting technology for typical small Indian farms and illiterate farmers is a challenge too.

## Our Solution

- A portal for small farmers with small pieces of land to collaborate together.
- Portal to buy equipment and guidance from experts(from non-profit organizations) on how to use them.
- Loan facilities to buy the equipment (At minimum interest rates possible by collaborating with government and different non-profit organizations)
- Motivating the middlemen to bring farming into precision farming in exchange for incentives for each successful implementation in a farm. (As they are the only ones who can bring the trust of farmers over PA and ca n provide loans easily and rapidly to them)

## Conclusion

> No matter how much we develop technology in the domain of precision agriculture, It will be useless if we aren't able to implement it on ground level.

Countries like the US, UK, and Denmark make the most out of PA but in developing countries like India (where agriculture contributes to almost 20% of the GDP !!), this method of farming is still not used at the scale at which it should be used.
The major reasons for this are lack of awareness and illiteracy in farmers. Other factors include lack of capital, infrastructure, and trust of farmers in technologies used in PA (over the use  of combines and tractors)
