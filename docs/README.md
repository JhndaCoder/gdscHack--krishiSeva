## About

Our Team HTML5 created Krishi Seva as a prototype for Digital Village Hackathon - A 24 hour hackathon organsied by GDSC , Thapar University , Patiala where we were the winners of the best first year hack

The theme of the whole hackahton was Precision Agriculture and all the problem statements were based on devolping the persisting technology in P.A even more but their was no focus on its Implementation so we choose to work under Open-Innovation category to solve this challenge.

# Precision Agriculture

 ## What is Precision Agriculture

?> Precision Agriculture is basically the ‘right-input’ at the ‘right-time’ in the ‘right-amount’ at the ‘right place’ and in the ‘right-manner’ for improving productivity, conserving natural resources, and avoiding any ecological or social tribulations

 ## Advantages of Precision Agriculture

- It will enhance agricultural productivity and prevent soil degradation in cultivable land resulting in sustained agricultural development.
- It will reduce excessive chemical usage in crop production.
- Water resources will be utilized efficiently under precision farming.
- GPS allows agricultural fields to be surveyed with ease. Moreover, the yield and soil characteristics can also be mapped.
- Dissemination of information about agricultural practices to improve quality, quantity, and reduced cost of production in agricultural crops.
- It will minimize the risk to the environment, particularly with respect to nitrate leaching and groundwater contamination by means of the optimization of agro-chemical products.
- Non-uniform fields can be sub-divided into smaller plots based on their unique requirements.
- It provides opportunities for better resource management and hence reduce wastage of resources

 ## Disadvantages of Precision Agriculture

- High capital costs may discourage farmers from not embracing this method of farming.
- Precision agriculture techniques are still under development and require expert advice before actual implementation.
- It may take several years before the actual collection of sufficient data to fully implement the system.
- It is an extremely difficult task particularly the collection and analysis of data.

# Challenges in adopting Precision Agriculture in India

- The adoption of precision farming in India is yet in the nascent stage due to its unique pattern of land holdings, poor infrastructure, lack of farmers’ inclination to take the risk, social and economic conditions, and demographic conditions
- The small size of landholdings in most of the Indian agriculture limits economic gains from currently available precision farming technology.

 ## Miscellaneous

<!-- This section showcases some functionality of Docsify.

```bash
echo "Hello, World"
``` -->

- With the Indian agriculture sector growing at less than four percent per annum, it would take — at the current pace — 25 years for farmers’ income to double. But the Modi government’s aim to achieve it by 2022, in less than five years, certainly looks ambitious.
- Precision farming comes at a cost of ₹2 lakh per hectare. Also, adapting technology for typical small Indian farms and illiterate farmers is a challenge too.


# Our Solution

- A portal for small farmers with small pieces of land to collaborate together.
- Portal to buy equipment and guidance from experts(from non-profit organizations) on how to use them.
- Loan facilities to buy the equipment (At minimum interest rates possible by collaborating with government and different non-profit organizations)
- Motivating the middlemen to bring farming into precision farming in exchange for incentives for each successful implementation in a farm. (As they are the only ones who can bring the trust of farmers over PA and ca n provide loans easily and rapidly to them)

 ## Conclusion

> No matter how much we develop technology in the domain of precision agriculture, It will be useless if we aren't able to implement it on ground level.

Countries like the US, UK, and Denmark make the most out of PA but in developing countries like India (where agriculture contributes to almost 20% of the GDP !!), this method of farming is still not used at the scale at which it should be used.
The major reasons for this are lack of awareness and illiteracy in farmers. Other factors include lack of capital, infrastructure, and trust of farmers in technologies used in PA (over the use  of combines and tractors)

?> HTML5 has created *Krishi Sewa* to bring the solution to this problem.
