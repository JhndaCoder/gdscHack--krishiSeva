## What is Precision Agriculture

?> Precision Agriculture is basically the ‘right-input’ at the ‘right-time’ in the ‘right-amount’ at the ‘right place’ and in the ‘right-manner’ for improving productivity, conserving natural resources, and avoiding any ecological or social tribulations

## Advantages of Precision Agriculture

- It will enhance agricultural productivity and prevent soil degradation in cultivable land resulting in sustained agricultural development.
- It will reduce excessive chemical usage in crop production.
- Water resources will be utilized efficiently under precision farming.
- GPS allows agricultural fields to be surveyed with ease. Moreover, the yield and soil characteristics can also be mapped.
- Dissemination of information about agricultural practices to improve quality, quantity, and reduced cost of production in agricultural crops.
- It will minimize the risk to the environment, particularly with respect to nitrate leaching and groundwater contamination by means of the optimization of agro-chemical products.
- Non-uniform fields can be sub-divided into smaller plots based on their unique requirements.
- It provides opportunities for better resource management and hence reduce wastage of resources

# Disadvantages of Precision Agriculture

- High capital costs may discourage farmers from not embracing this method of farming.
- Precision agriculture techniques are still under development and require expert advice before actual implementation.
- It may take several years before the actual collection of sufficient data to fully implement the system.
- It is an extremely difficult task particularly the collection and analysis of data.
